# Report of Machine Learning course's challenge

## First Step : Data Analysis
<p align="justify">
Primarly we can see that there isn't any visible correlation between our different features.
We can also see that each of the features follows a normal law and there isn't
any visible "flaw" in the data, meaning that there's not so much feature engineering to do in order to fill missing values, filter outliers etc ...
Nevertheless, we do a feature selection using a LogisticRegression estimator and the Recursive Feature Elimination Class.
With this method, we can remove 9 features.
